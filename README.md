# gitSandbox
Sandbox to play with git and SourceTree

## 1. Get git GUI

1. Download and install [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).
2. Click the *Tools|Options* menu choice.
3. In the *General* tab,
  * Change the *Default user information* to your name and email address.
  * Change the *Project folder* in the *Misc* section to `H:\`.
4. Click *OK*


## 2. Clone your first repository

1. Click the *Clone/New* icon on the toolbar.
2. Click the *Clone Repository* tab.
3. In the *Source Path/URL* text box, enter `<gitSandbox-path>`.
4. Confirm that the *Repository Type* says `This is a Git repository`.
5. Confirm that the *Destination Path* is `H:\gitSandbox`. This will create a folder named `gitSandbox` in the *Project folder* you assigned earlier.
5. Click the *Clone* button.
6. Navigate to the `H:\gitSandbox` folder and confirm that you have the files listed [here](https://github.com/benjamin-chan/gitSandbox) (you may not see `.gitignore`; if you don't, don't worry, it's there but hidden)
